Are there any additional charges if I make my payment through the call centre?
A booking fee of INR 350 for Domestic and INR 550 for International + GST per passenger per sector (or equivalent) will be applicable for all bookings made from the call center and airport ticketing counter
How safe is it to give my Credit card number on the IVR?
With the IVR system, your credit card number is punched through the keypad on your phone and not provided verbally to the Contact Centre agent. Your credit card details are encrypted and are masked in the PNR / reservation record and not accessible to the Customer Care agent. The entire process is fully automated and ensures security of your card information
Are Debit cards accepted for bookings on IVR?
No. Currently we accept only Credit cards for bookings on IVR.
Which credit card types are accepted for booking on IVR?
We accept MasterCard, Visa, Amex, Diners and JCB credit cards, issued in India, for bookings on IVR.
Only MasterCard and Visa card are accepted for any card issued outside Indian boundaries. The travel date must be later than 7 days in case of payment being made on IVR through an International Credit card.
Can I book through the call center using my credit card for another guest?
While it is recommended to pay for your own flight ticket, you can pay for another guest using your credit card. However, in such a case the guest should carry a photocopy of (front side only) of the credit card used for purchase of the tickets attested by the credit card holder for verification at the Airport check-in counter.
Would there be any agent to provide assistance during the IVR transaction?
Yes. The customer care agent would be available during the call to help you until the entire ticketing transaction is completed.
Will I need One Time Password (OTP) during the booking process?
Yes, the IVR will prompt for One Time Password (OTP) during the payment process. The One Time Password can be generated on the call. You need to contact your bank for OTP before contacting the call center for making the reservation. You can call us for making your booking once the OTP is received from your card issuing bank.

What is the age group of an infant?

Passport
What if I don't have a valid proof for the infant's age?
In the event of a failure to produce a valid proof of age for the infant, full fare as applicable on the date of booking will be payable for the Infant and the Infant will be allowed to travel only subject to availability of seats.
Do I need to book a separate seat for an Infant?
No extra seats may be booked for Infants. Infants cannot travel in their own seat and must be seated in an adult's lap.
